# SpongeRemoteChests

**WIP: Nothing work, and probably this plugin does not load yet** 

SpongeRemoteChests 2.0 is a full rewrite of [RemoteChests](https://github.com/JonathanxD/RemoteChest) for SpongePowered.

# Getting Started

Crafts a linking wand (or buy one depending on the configuration) and right click on a container to link.

To see all linked containers type `/rmc gui`

# Features

###### Removed features (present in RemoteChest):

- Chest item linking.
  - In RemoteChest 1.0 the only way to link and access a chest is right clicking a chest with a chest in the hand, in the new version you need to craft a [Linking Wand](https://github.com/ProjectSandstone/SpongeRemoteChest/wiki/Linking-Wand), or buy using `/linkingwand buy`.

###### New features:

- Now you can link any container (including mod containers (thanks to SpongePowered :D)) (*but the name remains RemoteChests*)

- GUI to view all your linked containers and open them (in RemoteChest 1.0 you need to use linked chest, I've developed a similar system to 1.0, but I never released because I never finished :( ).

- It's no more for early game, now you've to find an Enderman and go to the nether to kill some Blazes :D.

- Easter eggs
